Influencer Detection in Social Media Using Degree Centrality

This project explores social media influencer detection by leveraging graph theory concepts, particularly degree centrality. The implementation uses Python with the NetworkX and scikit-learn libraries to analyze datasets and identify the most influential nodes in a network.

Project Overview
Objective: To identify social media influencers using degree centrality and other network metrics.
Tools & Libraries: Python, NetworkX, scikit-learn, Google Colab.
Datasets: Two datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Core Concepts:
Degree Centrality: Measure of a node's influence based on its direct connections.
Graph Analysis: Structural analysis of social media networks to detect influencers.

Features
Graph Construction: Build and visualize networks using NetworkX.
Influence Analysis: Measure node centrality to rank influencers.
Machine Learning Integration: Use scikit-learn for evaluating predictive performance.
Visualization: Display network structures and centrality rankings.
